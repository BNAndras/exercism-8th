# About

# Licence
8th is a commercial product, it is *not* open-source, nor is it licensed under the GPL. The free version is also subject to the same commercial license as the paid versions. 

8th comes in 4 [versions](https://8th-dev.com/skus.html): Free, Hobbyist, Professional and Enterprise. All have the same [builtin features](https://8th-dev.com/builtin.html) but differ in the extras. Non-free versions are purchased on a yearly subscription. 

# Unlimited usability 
Even if you produce an application with a non-free version of 8th which no longer has a valid update license, you can produce applications as long as you want and they will be usable indefinitely. 

# Compilation
8th's engine compiles your source to native code, at run-time, for the platform on which 8th is running at the time. The "run-time engine" contains all the built-in functionality 8th provides, but it is not a virtual-machine. 

# CLI and GUI
The 8th binary you use, along with most of the attendant tools are CLI, and usually are run from some kind of terminal. Applications you produce may be either CLI or GUI, depending on your needs. They can even be both. Of course, applications for mobile devices are strictly GUI based. 8thâ€™s GUI utilizes OpenGL and the SDL2 and Nuklear libraries, so your applications' "look-and-feel" is almost identical across platforms, to the extent possible. 

# No VM
8th's engine compiles your source to native code, at run-time, for the platform on which 8th is running at the time. The "run-time engine" contains all the built-in functionality 8th provides, but it is not a virtual-machine. 

# Client-server
8th's features include socket functionality, from the low-level up to high level "net" words. An "internet server" is included as well, making it simple to write your own communications protocol (or a web server). 

# External libraries
8th's "FFI" (foreign-function-interface) makes it easy to utilize libraries which are provided as "shared objects" or "DLLs". On Android, you can also call into the native Java libraries provided by the OS.
