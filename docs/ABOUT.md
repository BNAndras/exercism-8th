# About

[8th](https://8th-dev.com) is a strongly-typed, FORTH-derivative, stack-based language with RPN syntax. 

8th supports android, ios32, lin64, mac64, rpi32 and win64 platforms. 8th lets you use your preferred platform to write and test your code. With one click, you generate the executables *for* any platform 8th supports, *from* any platform it supports!

8th includes everything you need: cross-platform GUI support, strong encryption, SQLite database support, FFI, REST access, easy localization, hardware access, JSON support, a REPL and much more!

Security isn't an afterthought in 8th. It was designed from the beginning to avoid the most common software security problems. We continually work to make it even more secure.

8th has a [forum](https://8th-dev.com/forum/) as well as extensive documentation including a [manual](https://8th-dev.com/manual.html), and a hyperlinked dictionary of builtin and library [words](https://8th-dev.com/words.html).  [Compare](https://8th-dev.com/compare.html) 8th with other languages!
