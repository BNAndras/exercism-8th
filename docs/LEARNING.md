## In-program help

If you are typing code in the console and want some help, there are two helpful words at your disposal: `help` and `apropos`. The first lists all words whose names match the text given after it, along with their documentation. The second does the same, but also matches any help text which contains the text you type. A further set of helpful words is `words` and `words/`. The first lists all the words 8th knows about; the second lists all words whose names contain the text given after it.

It is also possible to get help without being within the REPL, by invoking `8th -? nm` on the command-line to get help on `nm`.
